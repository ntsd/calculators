The theory helps to predict things like queue lengths and wait times. It's based on mathematical principles and provides solutions related to several aspects of queuing processes, such as:

- Arrival process: How customers arrive at the queue, whether individually or in bulk.
- Queue discipline: The order in which customers are served, for example, first come first served, last come first served, or priority order.
- Service mechanism: How many servers are available, the time it takes to serve a customer, and whether or not a customer can be served by more than one server at a time.

Queuing theory can be used to design and manage services to ensure a good level of service while keeping costs under control. It can also be used to simulate different scenarios and understand the impact of changes on service levels and costs.
