Measure the throughput and the number of servers to understand how it will perform when scaling up.

Giving `N` as the number of concurrency, servers, or processors.

`C(N)` as the relative capacity, throughput, or tasks per second.

Click `CALCULATE` button to fit the `α` and `β` parameters.

> Recommend providing at least 4 sampling data for better estimations.

> The estimated output is only from the theory you can test again for more accurate data.

> The fitting algorithm is Levenberg–Marquardt from [ml-levenberg-marquardt](https://github.com/mljs/levenberg-marquardt) library.
